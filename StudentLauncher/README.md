# Student Launcher 2.0

A calm, distraction-free Android launcher for students. Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, no third-party libraries.
Developed by thats.jainam.

## Build
1. Open this folder in Android Studio (latest stable) and let Gradle sync. If Studio offers newer AGP, Kotlin or Compose versions, accept them.
   Pinned versions: Gradle 8.11.1, AGP 8.9.1, Kotlin 2.1.20, Compose BOM 2025.04.01, compileSdk/targetSdk 36, minSdk 26.
2. Run on a device or emulator, press Home and choose Student Launcher as the default home app.
3. Play Store: see docs/PLAY_STORE.md (signing, AAB, listing text, data safety, privacy policy, store graphics in store/).

This code was written without a compiler, so expect a few small compile errors on first sync.

## What is new in 2.0
- Wallpaper editor: blur, dim, and zoom + drag for photos (Style > Adjust wallpaper).
- Widget system: add, reorder, edit and remove. Long-press any widget to edit it.
  Clock (dot, digital, words, analog), date, week, battery, next up, exam countdown, study timer,
  tasks, quick settings, 3D sphere, glyph matrix, plus regular Android widgets.
  Each widget can use a Glass, Solid or None (no translucent cover) background, full or half width, and its own text colour.
- Glyph matrix: on-screen 25 x 25 dot display (Pulse, Spiral, Wave, Time). It does not drive the physical
  Glyph Matrix on Nothing Phone (3), which needs Nothing's own SDK.
- Side rail dock (vertical glass pill) as an alternative to the bottom dock.
- Focus reminders every 5, 10 or 15 minutes while you are in a distracting app you opened from the launcher.
  Uses an inexact alarm and a notification. No accessibility, usage-access or overlay permission.
- Smoother motion: home/panel transition, blur depth and scrubber wave run in the draw phase, so they do not recompose.
- Play Store readiness: target API 36, R8 + resource shrinking, signing config, docs, icon and feature graphic.
