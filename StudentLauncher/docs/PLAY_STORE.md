# Google Play checklist for Student Launcher

Developed by thats.jainam.

## Requirements this project already meets
- targetSdk 36 / compileSdk 36. Google Play requires new apps and updates to target Android 16 (API 36) from August 31, 2026.
- Release builds use R8 shrinking and resource shrinking, and build an Android App Bundle (AAB).
- No AccessibilityService, usage-access, overlay (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW), exact-alarm or QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission.
- The only permission is POST_NOTIFICATIONS, requested when the user turns on focus reminders.
- allowBackup is off, so no app data leaves the device.
- Predictive back is enabled and the UI is edge-to-edge (both are required behaviour on API 36).

## Build the release bundle
1. Create an upload key (once):
   `keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore upload.jks -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
2. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill it in. Never commit it.
3. Run `./gradlew bundleRelease`.
4. Upload `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` in Play Console and enrol in Play App Signing.
5. Before promoting to production, run `./gradlew lintRelease` and test on Android 8, 13 and 16 devices.
   New personal developer accounts may need a closed test with a minimum number of testers first. Check the current rule in Play Console.

## Store listing
- App name: Student Launcher
- Category: Personalization
- Short description (80 characters max):
  A calm, distraction-free launcher for students with widgets and focus tools.
- Full description:

  Student Launcher is a minimal home screen built for studying.

  Home
  - Your favourite apps in a Niagara-style list or grid, with an A to Z scrubber for everything else.
  - Liquid glass design, smooth spring animations and Nothing-inspired dot-matrix details.
  - Light and dark themes, your own wallpaper with blur, dim and zoom controls.
  - Monochrome themed icons, or your original icons, in the shape you like.

  Widgets you can add, move, resize and remove
  - Clock (dot, digital, words or analog), date, week, battery
  - Next up, exam countdown, study timer, tasks
  - Quick settings shortcuts, 3D dot sphere and a 25 by 25 glyph matrix display
  - Regular Android widgets too

  Focus tools
  - Study mode hides the apps you mark as distracting.
  - A short pause before a distracting app opens.
  - Optional reminders every 5, 10 or 15 minutes while you are in a distracting app.
    Reminders are plain notifications. The app never watches what you do and needs no special access.

  Private by design: no accounts, no ads, no tracking. Everything stays on your phone.

## Data safety form
- Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? No.
- Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? Not applicable, no data leaves the device.
- Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? Not applicable, no data is collected.
- Permissions to explain if asked: POST_NOTIFICATIONS, only for the optional focus reminders.

## Content rating and audience
- Answer the IARC questionnaire honestly: no violence, no user-generated content, no purchases, no ads.
- Target audience: choose 13 and over unless you are ready to meet the Families policy for children under 13.

## Policy notes
- Say clearly in the listing that this is a home screen replacement.
- Do not describe it as parental control or as an app blocker. It hides apps inside the launcher and sends reminders, it does not block other launchers or apps.
- Reminders are inexact alarms and can arrive a little late when the phone is in battery saver.
